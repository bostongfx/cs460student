  Ro.ME was probably the coolest interactice music video i watched. it was made around 2011
  where you can explore different 3D dreams world while listing to music. I'm fascinated that this was made
  in 2011, how they were able to put together music, story, and an interactive experience all into this WebGL demo. 
  seeing the bird move with my mouse and the camera flow with the music was amazing. Its impact was 
  showing people that browsers could handle real-time 3D and storytelling without plugins, 
  and it inspired many later projects that used WebGL for creative work on the web.

  the Ro.ME demo was built with WebGL for the 3D graphics. It also used HTML, JavaScript, CSS
  to connect
  the scenes and interaction.

<p id="comparison">
  I compared RO>ME with <a href="https://blobmixer.14islands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blobmixer</a>. 
  Ro.ME is more of a interactive music video white stories and exproloring. Blobmixer is more playful, it 
  also reacts with physcis and soft movements. And of course, Blobmixer has way better graphics.

  Significance (AI): RO.ME was a milestone in web-based computer graphics because it demonstrated that 
  high-quality, interactive 3D environments could run in a browser without plugins. It combined complex geometry, 
  shaders, lighting, and audio to create an immersive experience. RO.ME showed the world that the web could be a platform 
  for professional-grade creative work, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Its technical innovation and artistic 
  vision inspired a new generation of web-based 3D experiences, proving that the browser could support real-time interactive graphics.
