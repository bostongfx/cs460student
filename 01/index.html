    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->

      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      DESCRIPTION:
      RO.ME was created in 2011 and it is an interesting but a bit overwhelming experience since it shows 3 very different dreams into one story line. Each dreams shows different colors, 3D experiences, and different ideas. My favorite dreams are the last two, but for the first one I liked the fire coming from the fireplace. For the second dream, I loved how the animals were moving across the field, but the third was superb since the bird experience was very incredible. I understand how this was a completely new and amazing idea to develop because if I compared it with the Water experience we watched in class, this is like WebGL taken to another level since it adds a lot more graphics, lots of different colors and shadows, and even music integration.

      TECHNOLOGY:
      After watching the YouTube video that describes the technologies used in the RO.ME experienced I learned that Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi, Jack White, and Nora Jones developed a WebGL experience and they report in the YouTube video that they use multimedia with 2D and 3 D graphics, video, audio/music, all playing together at the same time using WebGL which allowed them to do real time rendering of the visual models they created using code. It was created to be played in a web browser and to allow the user to have an interactive and immersive 3D experience. 
        However, ChatGPT says the ones below are the list of technologies used. Code below copied from ChatGPT
        <div id="technology">
          <ul>
            <li>WebGL (browser-native 3D rendering)</li>
            <li>Three.js (JavaScript 3D library)</li>
            <li>HTML5 + JavaScript</li>
            <li>GLSL shaders</li>
            <li>Blender tooling/export pipeline (custom plugins used during production)</li>
            <li>Open-sourced code & WebGL demo set (Chrome Experiment)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
      </p>
      <p id='comparison'>
      COMPARISON: 
      I chose this website: https://blobmixer.14islands.com/
      RO.ME is an interactive and immersive music video that shows were dramatic dream worlds, while Blodmixer, is more my idea of fun since it shows 3D blobs that can help us relate to images that also have interesting font crossing over them and twisting as they crossed. It is very playful website to use.

      SIGNIFICANCE (AI): 
      
      ChatGPT says: 
      Ro.me 3 Dreams of Black is considered the first ever WebGL film, blending 2D animation with real time 3D worlds directly in the browser. It demonstrated how WebGL could turn browsers into powerful storytelling platforms, similar to video game engines. Viewers werenâ€™t just passive they could navigate three dreamlike worlds and shape their own experience. The project also featured a 3D model creator, allowing fans to design objects that could appear in others journeys, making the narrative communal.
      Directed by Chris Milk and created with Google Creative Lab, Mirada, and North Kingdom, it brought together art, music, and technology in a groundbreaking way. All code and assets were shared openly, encouraging experimentation and learning across the creative community. The video quickly became a viral success, with 2 million views in its first week, and it won awards such as the D&AD Yellow Pencil for Digital Design. Today, Ro.me is remembered as a pioneering moment in interactive media, showing that the web could host immersive, participatory storytelling experiences.
