      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      The RO.ME demo was an interactive music video experience where users were taken through a dream 
      with a series of different artstyles, themes, and enviroments. It uses 2D graphics, 3D graphics and video with webgl
      The impact of the demo is it showcased the possibilities of the things that can be generated by an individuals
      machine at the time using webgl.

      Technology: Javascript, webgl <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      style="color: rgb(85, 167, 234);"
      href="https://contra.com/project-rate-hiring-calculator/" > project rate hiring calculator</a> by Contra uses webgl. It differs from the
        RO.ME demo greatly because its a lot simpler, instead of giving the user the freedom to move around in an almost limitless way where they can change in any direction
        and have the scene adapt, you're presented with a 3D futuristic device that you can interact with, you do have some movement, but its limited to just rotating the device.
        But it still looks very cool and you can interact with the screen directly, or interact witha control pad on the device. there is sound like RO.ME that happens when you 
        select things, as well as background music.

      <p id='ai'>
      Significance (AI): RO.ME was a important because it was a huge milestone in which it showed you could create a fully 3D interactive experience
      directly in the browser. it combined audio, storytelling 3D models and procedural animation at a time where most peoples browsers weren't built 
      for heavy gpu processes. In a way it acted as proof of the possibilites of what could be done. (Chatgpt) <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
