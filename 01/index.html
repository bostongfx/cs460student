    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      The RO.ME demo was a pretty cool experience I got to interact with.
      Several types of scenes were displayed such as video, 2D, and 3d scenes.
      I was able to move my cursor around which generated a variety of animals
      and geometric shapes. My favorite part was the 3d scene at the end where
      you fly with the pack of birds. Looking at the behind the scenes video, I
      was surprised to see it was 14 years ago that the movie was made. I wonder
      how people from back then reacted to this movie.

      Technology: WebGL (JavaScript and HTML), a supported browser, a video card. <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: <a href="https://quantumstretch.com/">Quantum</a> - 
      this website is for a packaging company (a concept as I can tell). Both 
      this and RO.ME have an interactive element that the user can do. Quantum
      has the user scroll forward or backwards to view their "Quantum packaging"
      features, using hundreds of spaced dots to simulate shapes much like a 
      synchronized drone show. RO.ME allows the user to move their mouse to draw/
      generate a multitude of animals and patterns. Both very cool graphics.

      Significance (AI): My question to ChatGPT was "why was ro.me (interactive webgl demo) so important?"
      Summarizing its response, it was important because it showcased that modern browsers were capable of 
      rendering 3d graphics in real time. There was no need for special hardware, anyone using a supported
      browser can view it. Along with the technical aspects, it showed how the web can be an artistic medium
      for artists, increasing creative output. <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
