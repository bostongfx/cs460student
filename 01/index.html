    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <p id='description'>
      RO.ME is a very creative interactive demo and it incorporates several mediums
      to create a full project. It was released shortly after WebGL's official release
      in 2011, and served as one of the first large scale showcases of WebGLThe second scene takes
      place on a train in a plains and the user's gaze causes black ruptures to emerge amoung the green
      background. The final area is a desert and the user here is briefly able to create short shrubbery
      until eventually taking off as a flight of birds, allowing them to fly across the terrain and visit
      the previous zones. In particular, I was impressed by the desert section, and controlling the birds 
      to fly between the different scenes. The transitions were also smooth and the demo ran very well. The impact
      of the demo showed that browser based hardware accelerated graphics were possible, opening
      a whole new avenue for web applications.

      This experience like RO.ME has a heavy animal influence, but a very different theme. While RO.ME
      used the animals as a set piece in an interactive music video, World Flip is far more interested
      in the real life fates of animals and uses them to paint a picture about the relationship we have
      animals. Like RO.ME, World Flip takes the user through various worlds, exploring different environments.
      In World Flip, each world contains 3 excerpts exploring the world and how various futures play out in
      regards to our relationship with nature and animals in general. These worlds include harmonic futures
      where humanity has learned to live with nature, and more despondent futures where things are still alright
      for humanity at the cost of the world around us. Unlike RO.ME, we are not passive entities, rather in World Flip,
      we are instead asked to make an active decision of whether or not to 'Save' these futures, by asking if they would
      be able to accept the compromises these futures demand.
