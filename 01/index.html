      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! It was a fascinating demonstration of WebGL, and it definitely showed how much web development technology has progressed. 
      It was surprising to see that this 2011 music video effectively showcased the rendering power of WebGL. The impact on the computing power of the web browser
      allows users to actively interact in real-time seamlessly within the scenery. The switch in art style was the most captivating, which keeps you hooked. The 
      shifts between the art styles from 3D low poly to a 2D oil-like painting really give vibrant and unique colors at all times. It really makes you think how 
      much potential these frameworks have, and makes you curious about the improvement of our computing web browser that is supposed to be even more efficient 
      in the future.

      Comparison: <a href="https://le-voyage-azarien.art/interactive">Le Voyage Azarien</a> <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      The Le Voyage Azarien WebGL art offers a different experience in terms of the story and art style. It was meant to be a much more calming and relaxing story, while the art style
      utilizes the lidar sensor. The lidar sensor was used to capture and recreate the 3D object in small segments of dots. On the other hand, the ROME experience was a music video that
      matches the art style, where it feels like going on a wild and unknown journey.

      Significance (AI): RO.ME was the first fully interactive WebGL-based film that showcased real-time 3D graphics and 2D animations without plugins. It allows the user to navigate <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      dreamlike scenes that demonstrate modern browsers can compete with native applications in graphical interactivity. This pushed the boundary of computer graphics, inspiring many developers
      to begin their own experiences. - ChatGPT
