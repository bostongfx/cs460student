      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! This demo was created 14 years ago, I really shocked by how these creator telling a story or paly music by using interactive 3D.
      It's a amazing experience for me, I wasn't realize that I can move my view around using the mouse, and those animals are running along my mouse at first time watch the demo.
      Then I played many time to explore the demo. I think real-time 3D framework can really bring art alive, making people feel the contents in the art come true.

      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: They used WebGL, Three.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github. <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: <a href="https://wldlght.com/" target="link">Click here to visit another 3D work</a> <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      This 3D project compare to ROME is much smaller I think, the technology it used are WebGL and Unity 3D, not Three.js. This project only have two interactive thing, zoom into another scene and zoom out.
      Unlike ROME, wldlght focus on lighting, they have pretty good of light rendering. It doesn't tell much of a story.

      <p id='ai'>
      Significance (AI): RO.ME was a milestone in web-based computer graphics because it demonstrated that high-quality, interactivce 3D environments could run in a browser without plugin. It combined complex geometry, shaders, lighting, and audio to 
      create an immersive experienct. RO.ME tells the world that the web could be a platform for professional-grade creative work, accessible to anyone with an internet.It's technical innovation and artistic vision inspired a new generation of web-based 3D experiences, proving that the 
      browser could support real-time interactive graphics.  <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->

(AI used: Chat GPT)(Question asked: RO.ME was not just any WebGL demo - it was a tremendous milestone for web-based computer graphics. why RO.ME was so important)
