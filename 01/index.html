    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->

      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! Going through the demo I was reminded of some video games that I have played before. The cutscenes and then the segments where you are able to look around and control which direction you are moving in very much resembled Fortnite for me. Fortnite has live events where there are cutscenes but then similar to RO.ME there are segments where you can interact and look/move around in between the scenes. Taking into consideration that the demo was created in 2011 it shows how advanced and ahead of its time the demo was and there has been so many websites that are now using WebGL for their 3d models as we have seen in lectures during our class. So I can confidently say that it surely is a stepping stone for 3D visualization and web design.

      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: The technology that was used to create the RO.ME demo was very obviously WebGL. The languages used were HTML, specifically HTML 5 as well as the great JavaScript. <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: <a href="https://le-voyage-azarien.art/">Le Voyage Azarien</a> is a very similar demo to RO.ME that I found. It is similar in the sense that you are able to control the camera and change the angle and direction in which you are looking in. Furthermore it reminds me of some of the scenes of nature from the RO.ME demo with the trees showing up in the city streets, which was fascinating to see that although they portrayed trees they did it kind of different than eachother. The RO.ME demo had one main structure and the details on the structure were added over top but the Le Voyage Azarien had the entire strucuture built from a multitude of smaller particles which I thought was very cool and unique.<!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->

      <p id='ai'>
      Significance (AI): My AI of choice (ChatGPT) said that RO.ME was groundbreaking because it showed that browsers could deliver high-quality, interactive 3D graphics without plug-ins. Using HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL, it blended music, video, and real-time rendering into a cinematic experience, proving the open webâ€™s potential for advanced graphics and inspiring future interactive art and web-based gaming. <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
