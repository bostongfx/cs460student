      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a mix of video, music, and 2D + 3D graphics to show off
      what is possible using WebGL. As you go along in the story you can
      move your mouse to interact with the environment. In some parts your
      mouse will make a blur effect and in others it will lead animals and
      leave behind a trail of a different enviroment. This demo was meaningful
      because it showed what can be done when you hardware acceleration, and 
      shows whats possible with just writing HTML and JavaScript code. Made in 
      2011, it showed that you can enter an inteactable 3D world just from your 
      browser.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
       RO.ME is coded with HTML and JavaScript and uses WebGL with hardware
       acceleration to render in real time inside your browser.

      In this experience, you have full manual control over the speed of your
      progression unlike in RO.ME where your progress is based on the different
      parts of the song. This expereince is used as a way to for the company to
      show off what kind of UI and visuals they can create. Both Emotion and
      RO.ME show what can be done with web graphics, but Emotion is promoting
      their service rather than soley demonstrating whats possible.

      <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      "RO.ME: The 3D WebGL Experience (2011) was an interactive story by Google 
      Creative Lab and Unit9 that showcased WebGL as a powerful new browser 
      technology; it was significant because it was the first large-scale demo 
      without plugins, blended art, music, and storytelling, and proved the web 
      could deliver immersive 3D experiences that inspired future creative 
      projects" (ChatGPT)
