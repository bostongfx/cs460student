    <h1>RO.ME '3 DREAMS OF BLACK'</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- Screenshot of RO.ME -->

      <p id='description'>
        Description: 3 Dreams of Black was created in 2011 by Google Data Arts Team.
        I think its impact was big ( at its time , 2011 !) because it proved 3D graphics and interactive stories could run in a browser without plugins, and it pushed more developers to use WebGL for creative websites.
        RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo!
      </p>

      <p id='technology'>
        Technology: WebGL, HTML5, JavaScript, Three.js, CSS3, and maybe some API for audio and video.  
      </p>

      <p id='comparison'>
        Comparison: 
        <a href='https://www.no-fishing.net/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>
        No-Fishing website
        </a>
        <img src='image/nofishing.png' alt='No Fishing screenshot' style='max-width:300px; float:right; margin-left:20px;'>
        No-Fishing uses WebGL and Three.js too, but it is not as interactive as RO.ME. 
        It is more like a 3D art gallery, while RO.ME is more like an interactive story.  
        No-Fishing's main focus is to collect donations for marine conservation, while RO.ME is more like an art project.


        New Edit:  At the very bottom of the page, I added two models (fox and horse) that I found on mrdoob's website.

      <p id='ai'>
        Significance (AI):
        I asked ChatGPT why RO.ME was important.  
        It said RO.ME showed that WebGL and HTML5 could create interactive 3D 
        stories in the browser without plugins, and it inspired more creative 
        web graphics projects.
        
        Note: I used ChatGPT Model 5, 2025 to get above answer.
        Edit: I have used models from https://mrdoob.github.io/rome-gltf/
