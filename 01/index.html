    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->

      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! It's an interactive film that takes advantage of WebGL to showcase 3D graphics using your 
      computer's hardware. In the interactive film, you go through a sequence of 3 different dreams, each one being presented in 
      a different video media which you can navigate with your cursor.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      RO.ME makes use of various technologies such as WebGL, Three.js, Javascript, HTML, and Blender.
      </p>
      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: 
      <a href = "https://www.airforce.com/intothestorm/">Into the Storm</a> is another interactive film experience, similar to RO.ME! 
      In this experience, you navigate and go through the film largely by using your scroll wheel, as opposed to the RO.ME experience
       which you navigate through by moving your mouse cursor around to look more closely at your environment. Also, where RO.ME is more
       abstract and based in colorful visuals, Into the Storm is more grounded, with the film travelling through a gray, snowy mountain with
        audio recordings narrating the story of five survivors.<!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      </p>
      <p id='ai'>
      Significance (AI):
      According to ChatGPT, RO.ME specifically was significant because it was the first interactive film rendered entirely using WebGL. 
      It was an impressive demo that showcased how an internet browser could be used as a powerful rendering engine for unique and immersive
       3D experiences that utilize user control to make the experience interactive. The impressive demo even won multiple awards for the 
       technology it displayed, such as the D&AD Yellow Pencil for animation/digital design in 2012! <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
