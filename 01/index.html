      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is an incredible WebGL demo!. This WebGL website is an insight into 3 dreams, the dreams have been visualized as an interactive 3D world. It's like a music video made for the browser. The models are being rendered in real time depending on where the user looks to.
      RO.ME demo was created in 2011 and it was the first of its kind where a browser with WebGL was used to make immersive 3D graphics visible on our machines using our integrated graphics card. It showed that just with a simple tool like WebGL, such interactable and real things could come to life. 
      This really opened the door for creativity when it comes to web design fusing audio, video, real-time rendering etc.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      <em>Technology: </em>In this RO.ME demo, the primary technology used is HTML 5 combined with CSS for styling. Both these were handled under JavaScript and WebGL was the main highlight of this demo integrating audio, video and real time rendering really made this website a delight to go through! <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      <p id='comparison'>
      <em>Comparison: </em> The WebGL website I visited was: <a href="https://www.no-fishing.net/">Fishing Net Impact</a>
      This was a website that discussed the impact of fishing nets around the world and its deadly impact on the marine life. This website involved interacting with a globe to see the impact of nets throughout the world along with a slider button that would tell us the impact of donations on the fishing nets. 
      RO.ME, on the other hand integrates 3D models, videos and interactable elements that are there for artistic purposes. 

      </p>
      <p id='ai'>
      <em>Significance (Written by Chat-GPT): </em> It was important as it marked a turning point in web technology, it showed the world that browsers could deliver real time 3D graphics, sound, and interactivity without requiring plugins like Flash or Unity. By combining WebGL, HTML5, and JavaScript, it proved the web could be a platform for cinematic storytelling and complex multimedia experiences.<!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
