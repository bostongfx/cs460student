    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->
      <img id='screenshot' src='ROME.png'>

      <p id='description'> <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! I can see a lot of animals ruining through different environments, and the
      environments change as the music goes on. It starts from a some sort of realistic but non interactive black 
      and white scene (real time rendering), and then it slowly transitions to a low poly colorful scene that I can 
      do some interactions such as moving the camera and even adding objects to the movie. This demo came out right 
      after the release of webgl. It shows the potential of webgl and this kind of framework. We can do a lot of cool 
      and artistic things with webgl, and give audience a immersive 3D experience that could just run natively in the 
      browser.
      </p>

      <p id='technology'> <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      Technology: 2D graphics, videos, 3D graphics are all merged in this demo. The demo is actually a real time rendering
      model. The only usage of HTML and JavaScript create a 3D interactive environment. WebGL is hardware-accelerated 3D 
      graphics without the use of plug-ins. It use your video card to do real time rendering, so it is very fast and smooth. 
      It enables you to use your mouse to move your angle of vision, to move around objects and put objects in the scene.
      </p>

      <p id='comparison'> <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      Comparison: Unlike the RO.ME experience that I can feel the passion and the energy from different animals 
      and different environments from the video, the Le Voyage Azarien is a relaxing and quiet forest experience
      that gives me peace and calm after watching it. It creates a vivid and peaceful forest environment with some 
      birds singing and some leaves rustling that makes feel like I am actually in a forest. It uses LIDAR sensor to 
      scan a real world tree, which is different from how the RO.ME build their environment. The interactions are 
      boarder in RO.ME because I can put some stuffs I like in the video to make it unique, however, in Le Voyage 
      Azarien, the interactions are minimal. I am only change some camera angles or zoom in and out. Last but not 
      least, two of the videos have great music, but the RO.ME is music driven storytelling where the music is the 
      soul and spine of the story. The Le Voyage Azarien, on the other hand, the music is a supportive tool for that
      vivid forest environment. <a href="https://le-voyage-azarien.art/">Visit Le Voyage Azarien</a>

      <p id='ai'> <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      Significance (AI): When webgl just came out, most demos were simple cube or particle. RO.ME shows webgl
      can support cinematic immversive storytelling, and proves real-time 3D could run directly in the browser 
      without plugins. This was a radical departure from the past. It gave legitimacy to the idea that the web
      browser is a stage for art and storytelling, inspiring countless interactive projects afterward. It also 
      boosted Chrome's reputation. Google used RO.ME to market Chrome as the fastest, most advanced browser, 
      positioning it as the future of the web. (ChaptGPT)
