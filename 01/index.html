    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      The RO.ME demo is a very impressive WebGL demo considering 
      that it was created back in 2011. The technology at the time 
      was not that advanced as it is right now and creating such 
      a demo with limited resources makes the work even more admirable. 
      It really was a stepping stone into the graphics that we see on the
      internet today and the sheer difference in how advanced it is now compared
      to before.

      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: The technology that was used into making this WebGL demo
      was obviously WebGL, but more specifically 3d visuals that were made
      using code, mainly code in HTML(HTML 5) and Javascript playing onto the
      browser without the use of any plug-ins either.  <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: <br> Website: <a href="https://blobmixer.14islands.com/">Blob Mixer</a> <br>
      The Blob Mixer compared to RO.ME demo is similar in the sense that in the RO.ME demo, it's not only interactive
      but also whenever you move your cursor, things pop out. The difference in Blob Mixer is that you have to click a certain
      direction to change the blob to something else, which I guess may have not been a thing possible in WebGL at the time RO.ME 
      was made.<!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->

      Significance (AI): Source: ChatGPT <br>
      The RO.ME demo was important due to the fact that it displays 3D experiences that were not only interactive, but also
      could run on a browser with the use of WebGL without needing the use of plugins. Because RO.ME was able to use 3D graphics, unlike
      web graphics in the past that only used 2D, RO.ME also were able to add in music and storytelling that could be accessed on many 
      devices used today. The demo also showed the possibility of using the web as a platform to show 3D interactive experiences with the use of WebGL. <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
