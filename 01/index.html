      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a an immersive experience that utilizes WEBGL to take the user through a 2D and 3D film. It tells the story of a song through a three phase plan. The first phase begins with a couple 2D images that gradually transforms as well as cuts
      to new images. The second phase takes the user through a 3D world in which the user uses the mouse to inspect the world as
      well as direct a stream of graphics through a predetermined track. The third phase retains similar elements from the second phase but also expands on it by allowing the user to direct themselves through the world.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
        RO.ME uses javascript and HTML to utilize the GPU in your computer to render images in your browser.

      <a href = "https://lusion.co/" target="_blank" title="Secondary Reference">
        Try Me 
      </a>
      Lusion is another example of browser graphical rendering. While RO.ME takes you through a modeled experience, Lusion
      is based more in user web-based interaction. As you scroll through the website, the user is met with interaction canvases that demonstrate the power of WEBGL just as well.

      Significance (AI): <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      In conclusion, RO.ME was revolutionary and has opened doors for web development. I had a conversation with CHATGPT and this
      is what it had to say 
      "RO.ME â€“ 3 Dreams of Black was a groundbreaking interactive music video created in 2011 that showcased the power of WebGL and HTML5, allowing real-time 3D storytelling directly in the browser. It combined music, art, and technology in a way that pushed the boundaries of digital storytelling and interactive media. As one of the first major web-based 3D experiences, it influenced future interactive projects and helped shape the evolution of immersive web experiences."
