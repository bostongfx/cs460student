      "3 Dreams of Black" doubles as a prominent demo of WebGL technology and an experimental film
      based on a concept album. Over music by two musicians, Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi, the film
      goes through scenes of interactive visuals right in your browser.

      <!-- (Done) technologies used -->
      Technology: WebGL, implemented with the Three.js library

      <p id='comparison'>
      <!-- (Done) comparison -->
      Comparison: <a href="https://www.no-fishing.net/">"no-fishing.net"</a> is a campaign created by the 
      organization "Sea Shephard" designed to protect fish populations by cleaning up the ocean and 
      combatting over-fishing. Their website makes use of WebGL to give visitors an engaging summary of 
      the work they do and how you can help. Like RO.ME, no-fishing.net starts with a short traditional 
      video section. But after the video, the site takes a different approach from RO.ME by leaving the 
      user a model of the Earth which they can rotate and interact with to read more at their own pace.

      <!-- (Done) AI output summary -->
      Significance (AI): For this section, I used ChatGPT. In a new chat with no login, I sent this message:
      "Do you know the WebGL experiment called ROME '3 Dreams of Black'? Can you explain its significance as 
      a milestone for web-based computer graphics?" The AI responded with a multi-paragraph breakdown to
      answer, including two subsections titled "Why Was It a Milestone?" and "Broader Impact". To summarize
      ChatGPT's response, I'll highlight a few of the bullet points. According to ChatGPT, '3 Dreams of 
      Black' was one of the first high-profile examples of WebGL's real-time 3D graphics when it was 
      released in 2011. As a result, the project drew a lot of attention in the industry for WebGL, boosting
      its reputation and leading to its use in further art pieces as well as educational tools.
