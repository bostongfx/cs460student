      3 Dreams of Black is an interactive WebGL music experience  created by Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi and Chris Milk. 
      It's an experience that features a combination of 2D graphics, video and 3D graphics all playing together through WebGL
      During the time of its release, it was one of the first extensive demonstrations of real-time 3D graphics that was able to run natively in the browser without additional plugins.
      It essentially showcased the capabilities of WebGL to transform the browser into an open source video game console.
      This project served as inspiration for a future generation of web based graphics and showcased how WebGL could be used for creative storytelling.

      Technology: WebGL, 3D

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: Comparison: My experience with Ro.me and Le Voyage Azarien was vastly different. Ro.me hits just like a music video where everything is very cinematic and it's very loud and high-energy.
        La Voyage Azarien on the other hand is slower and far more meditative. Instead of set piece shots, it feels like you're floating inside trees as you drift through
        the forest at your own pace. While they both push 3D on the web, there are a lot of difference in functionality and vibes overall. Link: https://le-voyage-azarien.art/

      <p id='ai'>
      Significance (AI): According to ChatGPT, RO.ME was a milestone because it showed that WebGL could deliver
      hardware-accelerated 3D graphics natively in the browser, inspiring future interactive web experiences.
