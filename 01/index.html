    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>
    <p>Connor Finnegan</p>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->
      <img id='screenshot' src='ROME.png'>
      <p id='description'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME starts with a short film of someone falling asleep. Then it feels like a dream, where we travel through the dream
      and visit certain stops. At one point it is a geometric building/ruinscape. Another aspect we are taken on a train, where 
      we see buffalos running and they turn into demon like figures. It also showed a lot of birds following us, and giving us free will with
      a free world desert where we could move on all axis for full free reign motion. It also had options to blur/pixelated a small circle
      around where the mouse was. Seems like there was so underlying themes about nature and climate change, I could see it in the desert with
      the floating city and how after a point I started creating a grass/flower trail. And mor eimprotantly it showed a standard for web design 
      that is more advanced than anything at its time and how easy it could be and that was over a decade ago.
      </p>
      <p id='technology'>
      Technology:  <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      The technology used for RO.ME is webgl. That is used to create the 3d scape as you travel through the different dreams. It also has a 
      combination of different sounds and music as well as actual video that starts off the project before the person falls asleep. It uses
      3d renders to render all the animals we see, the brids, deer, fish, and other animals we see. 
      </p>
      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison:  <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      Another webgl example <a href="https://mfisher-apollonas.com/">https://mfisher-apollonas.com/</a> called "The Quarry House" is a simialr
      experience to RO.ME. Except now instead of a dream and geometric shapes and animals we are touring a house, wiht interactive objects when
      if clicked give a description of the object, how much it cost and provides a picture of it. It uses the same technology except it is a different 
      experience, givign emphasis on the stone used to create the objects and the house being built in a quarry with having an about section and gallery which acts more like a art gallery 
      than a music video/walkthrough since you can go at your own pace.
      </p>
      <p id='ai'>
      Significance (AI): <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
        I asked chatgpt the phrase "why was RO.ME so important", to paraphrase: In 2011 when it was showcased it showed that it was possible to create
        real time interactive 3d graphics in the web for the first time using webgl. It promoted a new standard for web graphics promoted by chrome.
        It provided a new experience that a user could interact with the video, picture, and/or envirorment that was being created.
