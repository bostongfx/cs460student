      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is an interactive WebGL film that was created by Chris Milk with some friend from Google and it was released in 2011.
      In this demo, the user interacts with the world simply by moving the mouse.
      It controls the camera and triggers beautiful animations like geometric animals and plants appearing in the 
      city, birds flying across the desert as the ground turn green. The project showcases the potential of WebGL
      able to create beautiful 3d animations and visuals by combination of storytelling and music that run in browsers.
      It impacts many others to share their creative ideas through Webgl.

      Comparison: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      <a href="https://egghunt.merci-michel.com/"> MSI - Egg Hunt </a> 
      <br> This is another WebGL based Project that showcases a different aspect of WebGL's potential. Unlike RO.ME which is an interactive film
      with visuals and music, MSI- Egg Hunt is a game where you control a bunny-like robot character that dashes super  fast forward. The goal is 
      to collect eggs and dodge the moving rocks. The faster you move, the more eggs you can earn before they merge into one.
      If you hit a rock, the game is over. The game has amazing animation for bunny dash and during collision. The MSI- Egg Hunt experience is 
      very different to RO.ME because you play the Egg game again and again to get high score, while Rome - "3 Dreams of Black" is an interactive film that you experience
      for its creative animation and music.

      Significance (AI):  <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      RO.ME was a major achievement because it used WebGL technology to create complex, real time 3D world that run directly in a web browser without
      plugins like Flash. Before RO.ME, projects like this usually required dedicated software. Because of this demo, it inspired many developer to explore webGL leading to a wave of 
      interactive webGl projects.
