      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo!  It incorpates video, 2d animation and 3d visual graphics with the 
      song/dreams to create an immersive and interactive world/narrative.  It had very smooth transitions 
      between the different forms of media.  In 2d you could start moving the camera slightly, while in 3d 
      there was free control including having flora and animals being rendered where the mouse pointed at.  The
      visual designs encapsulted the mood and story of the song very well such as having the scene where the mouse
      turned everything black.  Considering this video was created around 14 years ago it had showcased the
      possibilities of visual graphics in web browsers especially for music/songs.

      <p id='technology'>
      Technology: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      RO.ME used HTML, JavaScript, WebGL, audio, 3D visuals created with code, 
      uses video card to render graphics, three.js.

      Comparison: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      https://le-voyage-azarien.art/
      Compared to the RO.ME, the concept of this webgl is simpler.  A person narrates about the forest
      and trees while we are given blob-like visualaztions of the tree. The visualization and sound makes 
      a deep and profound atmosphere for the narration of the story.  It shows how the person is giving
      appreciation for the tree and how it relates to themselves.  Unlike the RO.ME it gives a more direct
      story telling with simpler visuals.  There wasn't free camera movement compared to the RO.ME and no visuals
      being created with the mouse.  I think it focuses a lot more on the person's words with the visuals
      as the support while the RO.ME sometimes feels like the song is supporting the visuals more.

      Significance (AI):<!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      </p>
      RO.ME: “3 Dreams of Black” was a milestone for the web because it proved that cinematic, 
      interactive 3D experiences could run directly in the browser without plugins, using only open web 
      technologies like WebGL, HTML5, and JavaScript. Unlike earlier tech demos, it combined art and 
      storytelling with cutting-edge graphics, letting users explore dreamlike worlds and even contribute 
      their own creations. This project showed the creative potential of WebGL at scale and helped 
      establish the web as a serious platform for high-end interactive media.
