      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is an immersive WebGL music video that allows the 
      visitor of the website to move their view according to 
      where their cursor is located. The website incorporates 
      elements of not only recorded videos/images, but also 2D 
      art and 3D art in order to make the whole experience 
      stimulating in a very creative way. The film takes the 
      visitor through several different scenes and also allow 
      the visitor to control where the animals move. 
      This web film was made in 2011, the same year that WebGL 
      1.0 was officially released. This project demonstrated 
      how powerful browsers could really be and what awesome 
      works could be produced!

      <p id='comparison'>
      <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE COMPARISON -->
      Comparison: <a href= https://www.houseofdreamers.fr/en>House of Dreamers</a><br>
      The House of Dreamers website was made WebGL, Transition, 
      and GSAP. It features a fluid effect on mouse cursor 
      movement, smooth page transitions from one 3D dreamlike 
      scene to another, and looping music. The graphics are 
      beautifully rendered; it's what you would expect from a 
      game. There is also slight camera movement as the the 
      cursor moves and to butterflies periodically fluttering 
      in the foreground of the scenes.

      <p id='ai'>
      <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      Significance (ChatGPT): The RO.ME WebGL site was 
      significant because it marked a turning point in showing 
      that the web could be a platform for cinematic, interactive 
      3D experiences â€” without external plugins.
