      <!-- Description -->
      <p id="description">
        Ro.ME was probably the coolest interactive music video I watched. It was made around 2011,
        where you can explore different 3D dream worlds while listening to music. I'm fascinated that this was made
        in 2011â€”how they put music, story, and an interactive experience together in a WebGL demo.
        Seeing the bird move with my mouse and the camera flow with the music was amazing. Its impact was showing people
        that browsers could handle real-time 3D and storytelling without plugins, and it inspired many later projects that
        used WebGL for creative work on the web.
      </p>

      <!-- Technology -->
      <p id="technology">
        The Ro.ME demo was built with WebGL for 3D graphics. It also used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
        to connect the scenes and interaction. Shaders and audio APIs helped sync visuals with the music,
        and 3D models/textures were loaded in real time.
      </p>

      <!-- Comparison -->
      <p id="comparison">
        I compared RO.ME with <a href="https://blobmixer.14islands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blobmixer</a>.
        RO.ME is more like an interactive music video with story and exploring.
        Blobmixer is more playful and reacts with physics and soft movements.
        And of course, Blobmixer has better modern graphics.
      </p>

      <!-- AI -->
      <p id="ai">
        Significance (AI): RO.ME was a milestone in web-based computer graphics because it demonstrated that
        high-quality, interactive 3D environments could run in a browser without plugins. It combined complex geometry,
        shaders, lighting, and audio to create an immersive experience. RO.ME showed the world that the web could be a
        platform for professional-grade creative work, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Its technical
        innovation and artistic vision inspired a new generation of web-based 3D experiences, proving that the browser
        could support real-time interactive graphics. <em>(Answer generated by ChatGPT.)</em>
