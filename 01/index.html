    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <p id='description'>
      RO.ME is an interactive WebGL music video with first person storytelling about three dreams. <br>
      Dream 1: We follow the main character driving alone through a end of the world land, past ruined buildings. She reaches a house like room, spends the night, and eats simple cooked beans. Then she fall asleep, close her eyes. <br>
      Dream 2: The main character then opens her eyes, incident she wokes up. The visual style shifts. The character then drives beyond the zone into a wider world. As you move the mouse, grasses sprout and animals run across the mouse you pointed at.<br>
      Dream 3: The visual style shifts again. The story start from the main character wake up on a train. There are oxs run along the train. The character gets off the train and wanders through a open land, continuing the journey on foot. While you move the mouse, the world continues to shift. More subtle stuffs reacted, like dust and small birds.

      Comparison:  In this demo, the camera is mostly fixed, with limited left and right movement. You can scroll using the middle mouse button to move in a restricted path through the scene, and at the beginning of the day, clicking and holding the left mouse button causes the camera to zoom in toward a helicopter. One interaction transitioning between day and night. Another interaction moves the helicopter itself.
       Compared to RO.ME which use a free camera that follows the main character, this demo feels more restricted. Here, interactions are mainly done through clicking and scrolling to affect objects, while in RO.ME, interaction happens by simply moving the mouse, which brings the world more lifely.

      Significance (AI): RO.ME wasn't just a WebGL experiment, it was a bold proof that the browser could be a stage for real-time, cinematic storytelling. At a time when most websites were flat and static, RO.ME opened the door to interactive 3D worlds powered entirely by open web technologies.
