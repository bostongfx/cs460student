      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! It is an interactive movie that takes the viewer through
        multiple areas, in which movements with the mouse can direct a character travelling through
        the dessert or birds flying through the sky. This demo demonstrates the future of web development
        and the potential that technologies like WebGL and WebGPU have on creating more interactive and
        interesting websites.

        The interactive story I clicked on was much more informative, and its interactions
        felt a bit more substantial. I was able to click around the world ane learn more about
        the efforts of governments in ending illegal fishing operations, and the locations
        of ships.

      Significance (AI): <br> <!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
        AI: ChatGPT <br>
        RO.ME: 3 Dreams of Black was significant because it marked one of the first
        large-scale showcases of WebGL as a serious medium for interactive art and
        storytelling on the web. Released in 2011 by Google in collaboration with artist
        Chris Milk and the design studio North Kingdom, it blended music, animation,
        and user-driven exploration into a surreal, dreamlike short film.
        What made it stand out was that everything ran natively in the browser
        without plugins, proving that the web could deliver immersive, real-time
        3D experiences traditionally limited to video games or specialized software.
        This project demonstrated the creative potential of WebGL beyond technical demos,
        inspiring developers and artists to experiment with the browser as a canvas for
        interactive narratives. It also bridged music and visual art in a way that
        engaged audiences not just as viewers, but as participants in the unfolding story.
        In that sense, RO.ME was more than a digital experimentâ€”it was a cultural milestone
        that hinted at how the future of the web could merge technology and art into new
        forms of expression.
