    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <img id='screenshot' src='./ROME.png'>
      <p id='description'>
      RO.ME is an incredible piece of technology utilizing the capabilities of WebGL. I have never really seen/experienced a 
      piece of interactive technology in this manner in 2025, and this project was created over 14 years ago, where it was 
      probably considered revolutionary at the time. I've played plenty of video games, but to have a constantly moving
       movie/video play while you can interact with it and change things really astounded me. You have parts of the video 
       where the camera pans to wherever your mouse is pointing/moving towards, other parts where you paint the ground actively
        black with your mouse as you travel through it, animals running around you which transforms into other animals actively
         while you're still trying to play with it and figure out how the interactivity works. Truly a great piece of artistic design.

      <p id='comparison'>
      Comparison: Link to the website I chose: <a href="https://promo.emotion-agency.com/" target="_blank">https://promo.emotion-agency.com/</a>
      <br>
      This promo.emotion agency website is very different than the RO.ME project, but maintains its own unique interactivity/fantastic visuals.  The website promotes an agency which
      can help personal or business websites design websites that are more interactive using the same type of technology as RO.ME (WebGL), whereas RO.ME itself is not an interactive
      website, but an interactive video.  The website showcases different visuals to entice the visitor to the site, but also to showcase what type of interactive sites this agency is
      capable of creating utilizing WebGL.

      <p id='ai'>
      Significance (AI): I utilized ChatGPT as my AI tool to answer this question.  I initially prompted the AI with the following: "Can you search the web and explain to me what the RO.ME project is, which utilizes WebGL?"
        Then, after ensuring it found the proper/correct information, I asked an additional prompt: "Can you explain the significance of RO.me, and why it was so important?"
        <br>
        The summarized AI answer is as follows: A Milestone for WebGL and Browser Technology - First-of-its-kind, Proof of WebGL's potential, Boosted Three.js adoption; Blending Art and Technology - Interactive Storytelling, 
        Dynamic Experiences, Collaboration across disciplines; Influence and Cultural Impact - Mass exposure, Awards & recognition, set the tone for future "web experiences"; Long-Term Significance - Pushed Browsers forward, 
        Inspired a generation of developers, preservation of digital art
